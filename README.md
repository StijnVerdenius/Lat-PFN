# Lat-PFN: LaT-PFN: A Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for In-context Time-series Forecasting
 This work introduces LaT-PFN, a novel time series model that combines PFN and JEPA frameworks to generate zero-shot forecasts efficiently, using a versatile latent space that enables adaptable time granularity and superior predictive performance.

# Work in Progress
