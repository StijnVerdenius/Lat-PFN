# Lat-PFN: LaT-PFN: A Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for In-context Time-series Forecasting

The official repository of LatentTimePFN (LaT-PFN) [available as preprint on Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10093)

This work introduces LaT-PFN, a novel time series model that combines PFN and JEPA frameworks to generate zero-shot forecasts efficiently, using a versatile latent space that enables adaptable time granularity and superior predictive performance.
